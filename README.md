# Shopify API Package

An extension of the work by Sandeep Shetty. Converted to OOP and to allow it to be successfully installed via Composer.

Requires our fork of Sandeep's Wcurl too, which has been similarly packaged up.

This code is not in use in a production environment yet, and bugs are likely. Method names have been converted to PSR-0, but some aspects may well be non-conforming.
